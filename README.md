# Laptop-Evaluator
Developed in 4 days for a university project, this system is a one page application designed to choose which laptop a client wants to buy and evaluates it.

You can try it [**HERE**](http://economia2018.informatica-unina.com/) (no registration is required).
The software is written using *HTML5*, *Bootstrap* and *JQuery* (+ *Chart.js*).

It provides 3 interfaces:
* the **client** interface lets you choose the market segment you belong to (data is obtained from a market study) and finds the most suitable computer for you from the database;
* the **design** interface lets you evaluate laptops using [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic); this evaluation is used to compute each laptop's final score;
* the **marketing** interface lets you compare a single laptop to all the identified market segments' needs in order to know wich aspect to improve.

I know, the source folder is a bit disordered: the files you may want to look at are *index.html*, *variabili.js* and *funzioni.js*.
